## Adding / Removing / Renaming Canisters

You will have to edit 3 files:

* dfx.json
* tsconfig.json
* src/agent.ts

More detailed instructions later. For now see how it's done in those files for the example counter canister.

## Deploying Asset Canister

For now you can only do this through [Fleek](https://fleek.co).

* Remove `ic-dfx-utils` from the project
* Choose `fleek/create-react-app` as the docker image in fleek
* Set publish directory as `dist`

## [Experimental] Watch mode for canisters
This will auto build and install your canisters whenever you make a change to them
```
npm run watch
```

## FAQ

#### Q: Is this usable for real apps or just for toys?

A: Yes 100% usable. You don't have to use webpack anymore. ViteJS bundles with `rollup` when you run the `npm run build` command. This can result in even [smaller](https://blog.logrocket.com/benchmarking-bundlers-2020-rollup-parcel-webpack/) sizes than with webpack (which most frameworks are leaving behind).
However when developing it skips that because it's unnecessary, and hence provides a better experience.

#### Q: I'm getting compilation errors like:
`ReferenceError: Buffer is not defined`

A: Double check that `@dfinity/...` versions in `package.json` are the same as in the original templates. I've locked them to specific versions for now because newer ones are causing issues.

#### Q: I want to modify things like directory structure. Can I?

A: Yes! Go wild. ViteJS is very customizable and has excellent documentation. This project is only aiming to provide useful defaults and to get you started quickly.
