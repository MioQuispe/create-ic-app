npm install
```
Start the backend
```

## [Experimental] Watch mode for canisters
This will auto build and install your canisters whenever you make a change to them
```
npm run watch
```

## Adding / Removing / Renaming Canisters

You will have to edit 3 files:

* dfx.json
* tsconfig.json
* src/agent.ts

More detailed instructions later. For now see how it's done in those files for the example counter canister.

## Deploying Asset Canister

Run the following commands
```
dfx build
dfx canister install --all --mode=reinstall
```
Then grab the asset canister ID from the output. Shown here:

Now you can visit the following url in your browser to see it running on your local internet computer:

```http://localhost:8000?canisterId=<CopiedCanisterId>```
